# PowerteqReactProject
Branch this repo, add the functionality and push your branch
DO NOT COMMIT ON MAIN AND PUSH!
Instead, make a new branch with its base on main, and then commit and push that branch. Your branch should be something like firstname-lastname. Push that branch when you have reached the end goal.
You can see an example of what your front end code should look like at: https://wardmorg.org

Just like the problem set in part 1, please ensure that the code in your branch is your own. We want to see how you would implement the features, its not a very difficult exercise.
